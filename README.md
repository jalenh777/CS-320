# CS-320
Throughout this course, I learned how to use software testing and automation to make sure my code is functional and reliable. To ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I focus on using unit tests to check individual pieces of my code and confirm that they perform as expected. Creating consistent test cases helps uncover errors early before they reach production. I also review my logic and run tests frequently after making changes to maintain accuracy and stability. Security-wise, I make sure inputs are validated and that my code follows safe programming practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

When it comes to interpreting user needs, I’ve learned that understanding requirements is just as important as writing code. I try to think about what the user is trying to accomplish rather than just what the program is supposed to do. I use user stories and requirements documents to break down what features are needed, and I test each one to ensure the program meets those expectations. Communication and feedback are key parts of this process, especially when translating user goals into functional software.

My approach to designing software starts with planning and simplicity. I try to design systems that are easy to maintain, scalable, and testable. I begin by identifying the main components and how they will interact, then build out smaller parts while testing along the way. This helps me organize my workflow and reduce future issues. Through this project, I learned how valuable it is to plan early, test often, and write code that’s not just functional, but also reliable and clear for others who might use it in the future.
